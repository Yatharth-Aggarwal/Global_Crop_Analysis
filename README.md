# Global_Crop_Analysis

1.	ABSTRACT
In order to improve sustainable agriculture and solve issues related to global food security, this study offers a thorough review of agriculture data from throughout the world.
Assigning scientific names and symbols for standardized worldwide collaboration, the study identifies significant crops through advanced data analytics and machine learning.
To gain significant insights, elements influencing agricultural productivity are examined, including moisture levels, crop categories, weight, dryness, and other characteristics.
The study assigns weights to crops in order to classify them according to their attributes and provide a numerical indicator of their importance.
Farmers are assisted in making climate-resilient decisions by an overview of ideal circumstances and tactics for extreme moisture conditions.
The research looks into how dryness affects crop productivity and finds drought-tolerant crops.
Integrating variable that affects agricultural productivity, such as temperature, pest activity, and soil quality, results in practical suggestions for sustainable farming methods.
By helping researcher, farmers and policymakers make well-informed decisions, maximize yields, and build resilience in the face pf shifting agricultural conditions, the findings support global food security.
An important first step inn creating adaptable plans for a safe and sustainable global food supply chain in this research.

2.	INTRODUCTION 
In the face of a rapidly growing global population and the escalating challenges posed by climate change, the imperative to ensure food security and promote sustainable farming practices has never been more critical.
Agriculture, as the primary source of sustenance for humanity, stands at the nexus of these challenges and opportunities.
To address this complex and urgent issue, this study embarks on a comprehensive analysis of global crops data.
The overarching goal is to unravel the intricate web of variables influencing agriculture productivity on a global scale.
The focus extends beyond merely identifying crops and their scientific nomenclature; weightage considerations, and the prevalence of dryness.
By delving into the depths of these multifaceted aspects, the study aims to provide insights that can inform sustainable farming practices, foster resilience against environmental uncertainties,
and ultimately contribute to the enhancement of worldwide food security.
The synergy of data-driven analysis and agricultural science forms the backbone of this endeavor, underlining its potential to shape the future trajectory of global agriculture.

Problem Statement: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of global crops data to identify crops, its scientific name, symbol and factors influencing agriculture productivity, 
considering variables such as moistures, crop category, weightage, dryness, with the aim of informing sustainable farming practices and improving food security worldwide.
